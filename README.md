## A catalogue of papers on pollination for Chile, SURPASS project

We are proud to present you this publication catalogue that gathers all published papers on pollination (_sensu lato_) in Chile (from XXXX to 2020). This catalogue was produced in the frame of the [SURPASS2 project](https://bee-surpass.org) aiming to have all this information in one place. An important part of this catalogue is based upon Medel et al. (2018) review, published in **Plant Biology** [doi 10.1111/plb.12644](https://doi.org/10.1111/plb.12644).

This repository contains two major files:

(1) A spreadsheet with basic information of each paper included in the catalogue.

(2) A .ris file containing the full references of all papers included in the catalogue.

This catalogue is related to the **plant-pollinator database** developed by [REBIPP](https://www.rebipp.org.br).

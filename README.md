We are proud to present you this publication catalogue that gathers all published papers on pollination (_sensu lato_) in Chile (from 1982 to 2019). This catalogue contains **120 papers** :books: and was produced in the frame of the [SURPASS2 project](https://bee-surpass.org) aiming to have all this information in one place. An important part of this catalogue is based upon Medel et al. (2018) review, published in **Plant Biology** [doi 10.1111/plb.12644](https://doi.org/10.1111/plb.12644).

This repository contains three major files:

(1) A .csv with the information compiled from each paper included in the catalogue :closed_book:

(2) A .ris file containing the full references of all papers included in the catalogue :desktop_computer:

(3) A .bib file containing the full references of all papers included in the catalogue :computer:


We also include two **R scripts** to start working with the database, a RMarkdown file to generate a complete bibliography list, and a HTML file containing the the full bibliographic details of the 120 papers included in the catalogue.


This catalogue is related to the **plant-pollinator database** developed by [REBIPP](https://www.rebipp.org.br) :brazil:

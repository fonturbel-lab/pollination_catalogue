We are proud to present you this publication catalogue that gathers all published papers on pollination (_sensu lato_) in Chile (from XXXX to 2020). This catalogue contains **174 papers** :books: and was produced in the frame of the [SURPASS2 project](https://bee-surpass.org) aiming to have all this information in one place. An important part of this catalogue is based upon Medel et al. (2018) review, published in **Plant Biology** [doi 10.1111/plb.12644](https://doi.org/10.1111/plb.12644).

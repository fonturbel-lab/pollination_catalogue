	abstract = {A survey of the reproductive features of the angiosperm flora of the Juan Fernández Archipelago (Chile) is presented to provide a species-based review of reproduction and pollination, to identify generalizations associated with these systems, to understand the evolution of these features, and to utilize these data to promote conservation. The collection of original data was extensive, based on our own fieldwork, and was combined with data from existing literature. Data recorded include habit, sexual system, flower size, shape, and color, and the hypothesized pollination system of the first colonizers. In addition, the data on compatibility, presence and type of dichogamy, observed floral visitors, presence of floral rewards, and currently known pollination systems are summarized. Pairwise comparisons of different features are tested for statistical association.The flora is typically composed of perennials. The majority of the species have very small or small flowers. Inconspicuous flowers (i.e., a shape character describing flowers with no optical attraction) are widespread, as are dish-shaped flowers. Green is the most frequent flower color, followed by white and yellow. Most species are hermaphroditic, 9\% are dioecious, and 9\% are monoecious. Some 30\% of the species are protandrous and 7\% protogynous. Detailed studies of compatibility of about 14\% of the flora indicate that 85\% of these species are self-compatible (SC). Although most species studied are SC, their level of autogamy is low. Nevertheless, selfing mediated via geitonogamy is the most frequent mechanism of pollen transfer. Outcrossing is mainly achieved through dioecy and self-incompatibility (SI), promoted by dichogamy in the hermaphroditic flowers, and facilitated by wind pollination. About 55\% of the species offer nectar rewards, and only 2\% offer pollen rewards. Floral visitors are rare to uncommon. Two hummingbird species, one of them endemic, are considered as pollinators for 14 plant species. Flies, moths, and beetles are the native insect visitors to flowers, but they have been documented on only 11 plant species (7\%). Even insect visits to these few species were rarely observed. Given the infrequent, irregular, and imprecise nature of native insect association with flowers, there is no certainty that any of the species are truly insect pollinated. Two species of introduced ants and a new endemic bee were recorded as well; however, neither is likely currently important to the pollination of the native flora species.About 9\% of the extant flora is currently bird pollinated, and we hypothesize that 47\% is wind pollinated. However, we propose that most of the colonizers were ancestrally either insect or wind pollinated. There is association between a number of current floral features and the hypothesized pollination of colonizers. Therefore, to a large extent the flower color, shape, and size of the extant flora may express the pollination syndromes of colonizers rather than representing extant pollination. In addition, the presence of nectar in many species of extant flora does not necessarily indicate biotic pollination. Thus, studies of the reproductive biology on oceanic island plants need to be conducted species by species before broad generalizations can be made, because the observed features can be misleading.Possible changes in the pollination system were assessed by comparison of species for which there are reliable data with the hypothesized pollination of their colonist progenitors. The wind-or bird-pollinated species have retained the pollination system of the colonizers. In other instances, species seem to bear a different pollination system: from ancestral insect systems to current hummingbird-or wind-pollination systems. The lack of alternative means of biotic pollination seems to have led in a number of instances to anemophily—in essence a default pollination system. The lack of strong selection pressure for wind pollination and the relative youth of the archipelago may help explain why the features associated with wind pollination in these species are not so obvious.Because there are many recorded extinctions of vascular plants from islands versus those from continental areas, it is imperative to invest additional effort in protecting the remaining island species. Conservation or restoration programs cannot be effective without a deep and broad understanding of the reproductive biology of the plants. In order to conserve these plants, programs must involve a combination of reproductive and environmental measures. The ultimate fate of some species may depend on preserving the plant-hummingbird relationship, including the web of organisms that affect both plant and pollinator. The populations of introduced animals and weeds must be controlled. Experimentally produced allogamous seeds would enhance diversity in restoration programs. In addition, the preservation of habitat seems to be the central challenge to indirectly protect the unique island species.},

	abstract = {Chloraea lamellata Lindl. is one of the 50 taxa of terrestrial orchids occurring in Chile. In this paper we report the breeding system, phenology and pollinator activity in a population of the species located in the Province of Valdivia, X Región, Chile (39°28′ S). Chl. lamellata flowers from November to January, forming a lax spike with ca. 13 flowers. The floral life-span is 14 ± 4 days. The species is self-compatible. There was no statistical difference between the amount of seed produced after hand cross-pollination and hand self-pollination treatments. Neither direct autogamy nor agamospermy are involved in seed setting, thus pollinating agents are essential for the species' reproduction. Also, it has a high number of pollen grains (881733) and ovules (599833) per flower. The P/O ratio calculated is low (1.46). Probable pollinators belong to the orders Hymenoptera (Corynura chloris and Ruizantheda proxima) and Diptera (Sarcophagidae); these insects had a low visitation rate (0.00002 visits/spike/minute). The rate of pollination observed was low (28.6\% flowers with pollinia deposited versus 71.3\% flowers with pollinia removed). The reproductive features of Chl. lamellata suggest that the survival capability and long-term persistence of the species will be seriously threatened if the plant–pollinator interaction is disrupted.},

	abstract = {We conducted field studies on the Juan Fernández Islands flora on the breeding system of 25 endemic species from 17 families. We recorded data on flower features, pollen and ovule number, pollen/ovule ratio, pollen size, self-compatibility, floral visitors, and pollination. Flowers are mostly hermaphrodite, inconspicuous, small, and green. Six species are dioecious. Over 80\% of the cosexual species are self compatible. However, many species are dichogamous (mostly protandrous); thus, even the self-compatible species may require pollen transfer. Selfing through geitonogamy seems to be the most common system, and several species express mixed breeding systems. Floral visitors are uncommon to rare, except for two hummingbird species (one native and one endemic) that visit five species we studied. In more than 300 h of observation of flowers over three field seasons, we detected only 23 native insect visits representing ten species (Diptera, Lepidoptera, and Coleoptera). One species each of an introduced ant and an introduced bee were also observed on some flowers, all near the single human settlement of San Juan Bautista. Wind directly moving pollen, or indirectly via shaking the flowers, is the most important pollen distribution mechanism. The majority of the wind-pollinated species bear some typical anemophilous features, but also others not characteristic of wind pollination, that presumably represent the condition of their biotically pollinated ancestors. Floral features often reflect ancestral reproductive systems, so floral biology studies of oceanic islands in particular must be done with cognizance of presumed ancestral forms, because the observed characters can be misleading.},

	abstract = {Non-native plant species with a taxonomic affinity to co-occurring natives may perform best as invaders into plant-pollinator networks because their similarity in floral morphologies with natives enabled them to co-opt their pollinators. However, non-native species may impact the reproduction of natives by altering their pollination only if they share pollinators and if natives depend on pollinators for seed-set, premises that are often assumed but seldom tested. The non-native invasive species Taraxacum officinale (Asteraceae) co-exist and co-flower with other asteraceous species in the high elevation of the central Chilean Andes. In this study we determined the dependence on pollinators for seed-set in five co-occurring and co-flowering native asteraceous species and assessed the similarity in insect pollinators between the non-native and this five native species that differ in their floral similarity with the former species. Pollinator exclusion experiments were performed to determine the dependence of pollinators for seed-set in the native species. Characteristics such as capitula size and colour were measured to quantitatively assess the similarity in the floral morphology between T. officinale and the native species. The identity and visitation rates of insect pollinators that visit T. officinale and the five native species were determined. Native species were highly dependent on the transport of pollen by insects to produce seeds. T. officinale shared a moderate to high proportion (34–94\%) of insect pollinators with the five asteraceous native species studied, but the level of overlap in pollinators was not related with the floral similarity between the non-native and the native species. The presence of the non-native species T. officinale has the potential to alter the pollinator services to co-flowering native species in the Andes of central Chile, with no higher impacts on those species with the most similar flowers.},

Nectar robbing affected one-third of mature tree blossoms and 93.3\% of trees. This reduced the amount of nectar to about half. Foraging behaviour of floral visitors included pollinating visits to consume nectar and pollen, primary and secondary nectar robbing, and nectar theft. We found no effect of nectar robbing by C. distinguendus on seed production in E. coccineum, which was sparse and completely dependent on legitimate pollinator visits, mostly performed by the green-backed firecrown Sephanoides sephaniodes. Determining the effects of nectar robbing by ants on the reproduction of plants is important to understand the dynamics of plant-animal interactions in the temperate forests of Chile.},

	title = {High incidence of plant-animal mutualisms in the woody flora of the temperate forest of southern {South} {America}: biogeographical origin and present ecological significance},
	volume = {8},
	abstract = {The flora of the temperate forest of southern South America highly depends on animals for pollination and seed dispersal. This resembles more tropical settings and distinguishes it from other temperate floras. This high mutualism-dependency seems paradoxical and potentially “anachronic” in view of this flora’s present interaction with an impoverished fauna. We analyzed the frequency of biotic pollination and seed dispersal across woody genera classified according to growth form and biogeographical affiliation. We found that genera that probably originated in warm or tropical like environments of ancient Gondwana and the Neotropics, two of the main biogeographical sources of this flora, had high incidences of biotic pollination and dispersal. The rich endemic foristic element, mostly related phylogenetically to these two foristic sources, also exhibited a high frequency of mutualism-dependency. Many endemic and Neotropical genera showed distinctive reproductive traits associated with bird pollination, a type of mutualism nearly absent in taxa with other biogeographical affiliations. This suggests that many southern South American plant taxa may have evolved novel mutualistic associations in situ, probably before the onset of present cooler climatic conditions. We propose that, despite the current relictual status of many of these genera and their associated reproductive traits, dependence on mutualists is not necessarily “anachronic” in today’s cool climate and depauperate faunal environment. Our finding that the average southernmost distribution limit is similar both for genera that depend on mutualists for either pollination or dispersal and for those that do not support this view. The steep W-E rainfall gradient created by the rising of the Andes represents a more potent ecological filter than the N-S temperature gradient, sorting out forest plant taxa according to their dependence on hummingbirds for pollination and vertebrates for dispersal. Overall, we believe that plant-animal mutualisms in the temperate forest of southern South America are still well suited interactions, because they rely on animals that are abundant and show a high degree of residency despite being represented by a low number of species. However, present human-induced elevated rates of deforestation, fragmentation and habitat degradation may be particularly threatening for mutualist-dependent plants due to low redundancy in alternative animal partners.},

In this study, we review (1) the group of animals that participate in these relationships and their relative importance, (2) the community structure of these interactions, and (3) their degree of spatial consistency on a geographical scale based on studies conducted in two or more localities at both sides of the Andes. We also compare the plant-animal mutualisms of the TFSSA with those occurring in other biomes. Last, we present evidence showing how deforestation, fragmentation, and other forms of human disturbance are affecting these mutualisms. This work supports the hypothesis that the many plant species pollinated and dispersed by vertebrates in the TFFSA depend on a strikingly poor assemblage of animal mutualists. On the other hand, invertebrate-pollinated plants interact with an unexpectedly diverse assemblage of insect pollinators that include taxa present only in this biome. Although many of these mutualisms seem to be resilient, others appear highly sensitive to different forms of human disturbance.},

The reproductive biology of W. berteroi, W. fernandeziana, and a putative hybrid between 147.fernandeziana and W. grahamiae, endemic to Robinson Crusoe Island (Juan Fernfindez archipelago, Chile) was studied. Flowers are hermaphroditic, protandrous, offer nectar, and exhibit secondary pollen presentation involving pollen collecting hairs on the style. These features imply allogamy and biotic pollination. However, male and female phases overlap and no effective pollinators were observed. Experimental data indicate these taxa are self-compatible and facultatively autogamous, a conclusion also suggested by the pollen/ovule ratios. Selfing is accomplished when the stigmatic lobes reflex and touch the style, except for W. berteroi where they do not reflex completely. Autogamy is accomplished in the latter when pollen grains deposited on the inner surface of the corolla throat by the "pollen brush" are gathered by stigmatic lobes when shaken by wind. The degree of autogamy, and perhaps self-compatibility, seems to be inconstant, as implied by the variable natural seed set (overall range 21-188 seeds per fruit). A mixed mating system - primarily outcrossing/entomophilous, but also autogamous must have been present in the continental ancestors of these taxa. Autogamy promoting self-fertilization is important now - on an island with scarce pollinators - and in the past - when the first founders arrived.},

This consisted in isolating or excluding rapeseed plants from pollinators with exclusion cages. Treatments applied were total exclusion (T1), partial exclusion (T2) and free pollination (T0) with a density of 6.5 hives ha-1, in order to determine the following yield components traits: grains per silique, siliques per plant, 1000 grain weight and yield. The experimental design used was randomized complete blocks with three treatments and three replicates. Results obtained show that the parameter least affected by bee intervention was the grains per silique variable. In contrast, siliques per plant and 1000 grain weight parameters presented significant differences, contributing to a yield greater than 5 t ha-1; which represented a figure 50.34\% higher than in the treatment without bees.

	abstract = {Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are considered one of the most important pollinators of native, non-native, and domesticated plants. Pathogens and parasites, such as the tracheal mite Locustacarus buchneri (Podapolipidae), are harmful to bumble bees. We developed primers based on the mitochondrial CO1 gene for the speciﬁc detection of L. buchneri directly from samples of native Bombus dahlbomii and non-native B. terrestris and B. ruderatus. PCR products ampliﬁed and sequenced for these primers shared 100 \% identity among themselves and around 99–100 \% identity with other sequences of L. buchneri reported in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Japan. Bombus terrestris was the most infected species (41 \%), followed by B. ruderatus (31 \%) and B. dahlbomii (23 \%). This is the ﬁrst report involving L. buchneri in native and non-native bumble bees in Chile. Our described PCR-based detection offers a feasible, speciﬁc, and rapid method for the screening of L. buchneri in any bumble bee species.},

	abstract = {Low pollinator visitation in harsh environments may lead to pollen limitation which can threaten population persistence. Consequently, avoidance of pollen limitation is expected in outcrossing species subjected to habitually low pollinator service. The elevational decline in visitation rates on many high mountains provides an outstanding opportunity for addressing this question. According to a recent meta-analysis, levels of pollen limitation in alpine and lowland species do not differ. If parallel trends are manifested among populations of alpine species with wide elevational ranges, how do their uppermost populations contend with lower visitation? We investigated visitation rates and pollen limitation in high Andean Rhodolirium montanum. We test the hypothesis that lower visitation rates at high elevations are compensated for by the possession of long-lived flowers. Visitation rates decreased markedly over elevation as temperature decreased. Pollen limitation was absent at the low elevation site but did occur at the high elevation site. While initiation of stigmatic pollen deposition at high elevations was not delayed, rates of pollen arrival were lower, and cessation of pollination, as reflected by realized flower longevity, occurred later in the flower lifespan. Comparison of the elevational visitation decline and levels of pollen limitation indicates that flower longevity partially compensates for the lower visitation rates at high elevation. The functional role of flower longevity, however, was strongly masked by qualitative pollen limitation arising from higher abortion levels attributable to transference of genetically low-quality pollen in large clones. Stronger clonal growth at high elevations could counterbalance the negative fitness consequences of residual pollen limitation due to low visitation rates and/or difficult establishment under colder conditions. Visitation rates on the lower part of the elevational range greatly exceeded community rates recorded several decades ago when the planet was cooler. Current pollen limitation for some species in some habitats might underestimate historical levels.},

	abstract = {Diptera are one of the dominant taxonomic groups of animal invertebrates to be found in the highland wet pastures of the transitional desert of Chile. In wetlands, these insects play important roles as pollinators, decomposers and trophic resources for aquatic vertebrates. Additionally, Diptera are recognized to have the potentiality to be used as indicators of the health condition of wet terrestrial environments, important attribute in the case of Andean highland wet pastures given the water stress under which they are presently subjected. By using Barber and Malaise traps, the Diptera-assemblage associated to a highland wet pasture located in a transitional desert basin was investigated. This study was conducted during the growing season for the area. Its aims were to a) document the taxonomic structure of the assemblage in terms of the composition of Diptera-families and the relative abundance of its members, and b) evaluate the effect of the summer phenological phase on F-richness, relative abundance relationships, F-diversity and evenness. The PERMANOVA and t-pairwise tests were used to evaluate the effect of the summer phenological phase on the numerical relationships among families. The Simpsons D, Brillouin D, Berger-Parker dominance, and Fisher indices were used to estimate the F-diversity; in turn, the Simpson E, Camargo, Smith-Wilson B, and NHC indices estimated the F-evenness. Similarity between assemblages was compared by ANOSIM. The percent contribution by family to the observed differences between assemblages was computed by the SIMPER-routine. All analyses were done on the log-transformed data (x+1; log 10). 44524 Diptera-representatives were collected throughout the study, with a record of 27 families. The tests and the indices support the idea that the middle-summer phase provided the best environmental conditions for the diptero-fauna of the wet pasture. Apparently, this effect would be more related to the thermal pattern of the area than to the micro-habitat availability.},

(Asparagaceae) was evaluated with five controlled pollination treatments (agamospermy, autonomous autogamy, self-pollination, crosspollination and natural / control). Emasculated and unpollinated flowers did not produce fruits, therefore, this is a nonapomictic species and needs pollen for seed production. Fruit production via cross and natural pollination treatments were high with 70.0 and 90.9\%, respectively. Despite the low production via self-pollination (43.3\%), autonomous autogamy (90.0\%) achieved high values as cross and natural pollination treatments. The results for the mean number of seeds per flower were similar to fruiting. However, analysis of the mean number of seeds per fruit did not show significant differences. These results indicate that the population of T. plumosum is self-compatible with a high capacity for autonomous autogamy. It could be possible that autonomous autogamy of this species occurs when the stamens of the flowers move toward the stigma while they close and wither at the end of the day, corresponding to a delayed selfing mode.},

We surveyed bird assemblages in two old-growth ({\textgreater}200 years), two mid-successional (30–60 years), and two early-successional forest stands (4–20 years), from November 1999 to September 2000, on Chiloe´ Island, southern Chile (42°S). Birds were grouped into four habitat-use guilds: large-tree users, vertical-proﬁle generalists, understory species, and shrub-users that occasionally use forests. We recorded a total of 24 bird species: 21 in old-growth, 14 in mid-successional and 16 in early-successional stands. Large-tree users and understory birds were most abundant in old-growth stands, vertical-proﬁle generalists were common in both old-growth and mid-successional stands, and shrub-users were only common in early-successional stands. For nine bird species we found signiﬁcant relationships between their local abundance and forest structural elements. Higher bird densities in old-growth forests were associated with greater availability of canopy emergent trees, snags, logs and understory bamboo cover in this habitat. Accordingly, bird species diversity in forest stands can be predicted by the presence of these structural elements, and forests should be managed to conserve structural elements that create favorable habitat for bird species in order to prevent future species losses due to logging practices.},

The objective of this study is to provide detailed examination of the ﬂoral nectary in four plant species native to Chile: Quillaja saponaria, Eucryphia cordifolia, Escallonia pulverulenta and Gevuina avellana, all visited by wide diversity of insects including honeybees. These plants are responsible for the main production of monoﬂoral honey in Chile. The descriptions were based on direct and microscopic observation of several histological sections of the ﬂowers. The nectary of the four studied species, have very different structures, forming differentiated tissues. Our observations indicated that E. cordifolia and Q. saponaria have the highest nectary volume. On the other hand, E. pulverulenta and Q. saponaria have thick cuticles and nectar stomata. The secretory tissue in nectary of E. cordifolia was rich in starch, while E. pulverulenta, Q. saponaria and G. avellana were rich in tanniferous cells. With the exception of G. avellana, vascular bundles were always present in the sub-nectary parenchyma. The four studied species have exposed nectary and their ﬂowers exhibit similar morphological characteristics, such as colour, and petal coherence. The large number of ﬂoral visitors in our studied species, including A. mellifera might be associated with these nectary features and ﬂower traits, among others. This research, contribute to the knowledge of ﬂoral biology in Chilean ﬂora, which would be useful for studies in the ﬁeld of apiculture and plant-pollinator interactions.},

	abstract = {Pollination by animals presents important advantages for plant reproduction. However, relying on biotic pollen dispersers also exposes plants to challenges, which include, for instance, the need to match the ecologies and phenologies of the pollinator species. Because of their ecological simplicity, specialized pollination systems are useful models to understand some of the variables that modulate how zoophilous pollination evolves, and whether or not species involved in pollination interactions respond jointly to evolutionary or ecological processes. In this study, we used a combination of field work, species distribution modeling (SDM), and geospatial analyses to investigate whether the number of floral visits by different pollinators in specialized zoophilous pollination interactions is correlated with the climatic suitability of the pollinator insects and, thus, to insect potential abundance. To do this, we investigated the pollination biology of four Calceolaria L. (Calceolariacea) species from central Chile, and we sampled across their whole ranges. Our results indicate that the four plant species are pollinated by different oilbees of genera Centris Fabricius (Apidae: Centridini) and Chalepogenus Holmberg (Apidae: Tapinotaspidini), and that the number of floral visits varies at different localities. Our SDMs were accurate, successfully recovering the known ranges of the pollinators. Our analyses indicated that most plant species occur at localities in which insect climatic suitabilities are high. Furthermore, the number of pollinator visits at each locality was significantly and positively correlated with the insect suitability values, suggesting that matching high suitability areas can indeed increase the reproductive success of the plants.},

The bees were obtained from wild hives and moved to artificial hives. They were released into a 24 m2 greenhouse containing tomato plants. A similar greenhouse without bumblebees was maintained as a control. The result showed that 80\% of the tomato flowers were visited by the bees, measured by necrotic marks left in the stamen tube of the flower. On the other hand, it was possible to identify tomato pollen on the bee's legs and in the honeycomb of the beehive, so that the foraging action would favor pollen loosening of the flower anthers. A significant increase in the number of seeds was found on tomatoes with bee contact compared with the control. It was concluded that this species could act as a pollinating agent for tomatoes under greenhouse conditions. Average fruit set, weight and size were not affected by Bombus dahlbomii. It is necessary to evaluate this insect on winter and spring growing tomatoes.},

We analyse the importance of the invading species and the characteristics of the invaded community, as well as the role of disturbance on the invasion process, by presenting the most conspicuous of the best documented case studies: the wasps Vespula germanica and Sirex noctilio, the bumblebee Bombus ruderatus, and the leaf cutting ant Acromyrmex lobicornis. In their native habitats, these insects are common and have a wide geographical range. In turn, ecological plasticity appears to be the most important demographic trait related to invasion success shared by these species. We believe that climatic matching between the community invaded and the invader’s native range together with the absence of natural enemies are the community characteristics better related to invasion success. The role played by biotic resistance remains unclear. The successful establishment of the studied cases is related to some extent to resource liberation due to exogenous disturbance, or competitive displacement of a native species. This might suggest that the native hymenoptera community of NW Patagonia is species saturated, which in turn, could imply that species interactions are important in the community structure in environments where physical variables have been regarded as key factors.},

Pollination and seed dispersal are generalized mutualistic interactions, in which species with diﬀerent eﬀectiveness levels participate. However, anthropogenic habitat disturbance may hamper the impact of mutualists, jeopardizing plant establishment and recruitment. Important as it is, the eﬀect of habitat transformation on the joint contribution of pollinators and seed dispersers to plant reproduction remains little explored. To assess the eﬀects of habitat transformation on the eﬀectiveness of pollination and seed dispersal processes, we studied a highly specialized system that consists of a hemiparasitic mistletoe, one hummingbird pollinator, and one marsupial seed disperser species that inhabit native and transformed habitats in southern Chile. Pollination and seed dispersal eﬀectiveness landscapes were highly variable and did not diﬀer between habitats. Pollinator visitation and fruit removal were higher at the transformed habitat whereas seed disperser visitation and fruit set were higher at the native habitat, probably due to diﬀerences in structure and resource availability between habitats. In consequence, and contrary to our expectations, the coupled outcome of pollination and seed dispersal was higher at the transformed habitat, suggesting that persistence of the tripartite mutualism in the overall system is beneﬁtted from the presence of a native understory vegetation that attracts pollinators and seed dispersers and compensates for the often detrimental eﬀects of habitat transformation.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic disturbance can modify habitat structure and resource availability, potentially disrupting ecological interactions. This issue may be critical for pollination and seed dispersal, which determine natural regeneration. The mistletoe Tristerix corymbosus is almost exclusively pollinated by a hummingbird (Sephanoides sephaniodes) and dispersed by a marsupial (Dromiciops gliroides). We examined the extent to which human-induced habitat change and resource availability inﬂuence the interaction rate of this plant–pollinator–seed disperser system, along a forest transformation gradient (from native forest to exotic plantations). We estimated visitation rates of S. sephaniodes and D. gliroides on 70 T. corymbosus mistletoes using camera traps. We related visitation rates to habitat structural features and resource availability (ﬂowers and fruits of the mistletoe and the neighborhood) using spatially explicit models. Sephanoides sephaniodes and D. gliroides visitation rates responded positively to shrub and bamboo cover, moss abundance, and mistletoe spatial arrangement. Pollination and seed dispersal interactions were sensitive to the ﬂower and ﬂeshy-fruit neighborhoods, being variable across months. Further, D. gliroides showed a non-random spatial association with ﬂeshy-fruited plants. A larger sunlight incidence on disturbed habitats may prevent the disruption of key ecological interactions by increasing resource availability. This effect would result from the presence of shade-intolerant plants, which are beneﬁted by sunlight exposure. Patches of disturbed habitat may enhance landscape heterogeneity, providing complementary resources to the native remnants.},

	abstract = {Adesmia bijuga Phil. is an endemic shrub in central Chile, classified as a critically endangered species of plant. After more than 100 years since its original description by R. A. Philippi (1884), the species was rediscovered exclusively in two locations of the Maule Region. One of them, Fundo San Pedro-Las Cañas, is close to extinction with a low number of shrubs, occurring in a disturbed habitat due to plantations of Pinus radiata. This study examined the pollination biology and breeding system of A. bijuga in order to explain their small number of shrubs. We estimated composition of pollinator species attracted to flowers and visitation rates. In order to describe its breeding system in A. bijuga we used manipulated treatments to estimate autonomous self-pollination, level of reproductive assurance and pollen limitation. The results of this study indicate that only pollinators from the order Hymenoptera visit A. bijuga. The pollinator assemblage did not show temporary variation during the flowering season, with Bombus dahlbomii as its most frequent visitor. A. bijuga showed a mixed mating system that involves both cross- and self- pollination. The fruit set ranges from 20\% to 60\% in the absence or presence of pollinators, respectively. This selfing ability would provide reproductive assurance when pollinators fail. The taxon showed ability of asexual formation of seeds without the occurrence of fertilization by agamospermy. Supplemental outcross pollen did not increase female reproductive success, suggesting that the species is not pollen limited. All these factors may help to explain how this species has been able to survive over time in a small and isolated population. Finally, this work discusses how the results of our study can be applied to future A. bijuga conservation measures.},

However, in generalized plant–pollinator interactions this association may not be that evident, since pollinator assemblages vary in composition among populations, possibly influencing the direction and intensity of floral trait selection. In this study we determine whether there was spatial variation in pollinator assemblages and the selective forces they exert in ten populations of Alstroemeria ligtu var. simsii. We characterized the whole pollinator assemblage in ten populations, quantified four floral attraction traits and determined potential selection targets in each of the study populations. Our results revealed that populations differed in the composition of their pollinator assemblages, and the pollinators with the highest visitation rates also differed among populations. Using phenotypic selection analysis we detected significant differentials and selection gradients only in two of the ten populations, for corolla tube length and ratio of the nectar guide. The spatial variation in selection showed that linear selection acting upon these traits differed significantly among the studied populations. Our study indicates that selection can be detected in generalized plant–pollinator systems and brings new evidence of phenotypic selection variation in space for this endemic plant species. Future studies are needed to determine whether the selective patterns described here are consistent over time and whether they produce evolutionary change in the populations under study.},

To assess this, we studied the antennal sensilla of the subgenus Corynura (Callistochlora) Michener, which comprises species frequently collected in Chile and the Argentinean Patagonia. Although the species of C. (Callistochlora) play an important role in the pollination of wild and cultivated plants, there are no useful keys to identify them.

The sensilla have been important in the resolution of the subgenus, especially in the delimitation of male species. Three valid species are recognized: Corynura aureoviridis Friese, revalidated name, C. chloris Spinola and C. prothysteres Vachal. The male of C. aureoviridis and the female of C. prothysteres are described for the ﬁrst time. Lectotypes are designated for four names.

Corynura Spinola and Halictillus Moure (Halictidae: Augochlorini) contain species that are key elements in Southern South-American ecosystems. These bees are very difficult to identify due to close morphological similarity among species and high sexual dimorphism. We analyzed 170 barcode-compliant COI sequences from 19 species. DNA barcodes were useful to confirm gender associations and to detect two new cryptic species. Interspecific distances were significantly higher than those reported for other bees. Maximum intraspecific divergence was less than 1\% in 14 species. Barcode Index Numbers (BINs) were useful to identify putative species that need further study. More than one BIN was assigned to five species. The name Corynura patagonica (Cockerell) probably refers to two cryptic species. The results suggest that Corynura and Halictillus species can be identified using DNA barcodes. The sequences of the species included in this study can be used as a reference to assess the identification of unknown specimens. This study provides additional support for the use of DNA barcodes in bee taxonomy and the identification of specimens, which is particularly relevant in insects of ecological importance such as pollinators.},

	abstract = {Background: The Cactaceae is a diverse and conspicuous Neotropical family that has evolved a wide variety of adaptations during co-evolution with their interacting species. Recent research has indicated complex ecological and evolutionary interactions involving cacti and other organisms. Aims: We reviewed four studies involving cacti that have important implications for our understanding of the evolution of life traits and maintenance of cactus diversity. Also, these studies illustrate how the modern theoretical background of the ecology and evolution of species interactions is inﬂuencing the research in Cactaceae.
Methods: The studies showed here are (1) the evolutionary ecology of a mistletoe-cactus parasitism in central Chile, (2) the effect of an exotic grass on the demography of a threatened cactus in Puerto Rico, (3) the herpetochory in a tropical genus of cacti in Venezuela, and (4) the role of abiotic and biotic factors on the ﬂoral morphology in globose cacti species in northern Chile.
Results: The parasitic interaction between the mistletoe and a columnar cactus highlights the importance of spine length as a defensive co-evolving trait. Reproductive success in the endemic cactus in Puerto Rico was depressed by the presence of the exotic grass. Lizards actively fed on fruits of a tropical group of cacti, increasing the germination percentages of seeds. Climatic gradients might induce morphological change in the ﬂowers of Mediterranean cactus species.
Conclusions: Interactions involving cacti reﬂect a complex scenario of ecological and evolutionary processes which may account for several patterns of the diversity of Cactaceae. In this sense, to enhance the on-going research, we emphasise the necessity of the development of a cactus interaction database; the assessment of detrimental effects of invasive species on cactus diversity; and the quantiﬁcation of multi-species interactions.},

	abstract = {Background: Sympatric congeneric plants might share pollinators, or each species might avoid competition by evolving specialized traits that generate partitions in pollinator assemblages. In both cases, pollen limitation (a decrease in the quality and quantity of compatible reproductive pollen) can occur, driving the plant mating system to autogamy as a mechanism of reproductive assurance. We assessed the relationships between pollinator assemblages and mating systems in a group of sympatric congeneric plants. We attempted to answer the following questions: (i) How similar are pollinator assemblages among sympatric cactus species? (ii) Which mating systems do sympatric cactus species use? Methods: We studied sympatric Eriosyce taxa that inhabit a threatened coastal strip in a mediterranean-type ecosystem in central Chile. We performed ﬁeld observations on four taxa and characterized pollinators during the years 2016 and 2017. We estimated differences in the pollinator assemblages using the Bray–Curtis index. To elucidate the mating systems, we conducted hand-pollination experiments using three treatments: manual cross-pollination, automatic self-pollination, and control (unmanipulated individuals). We tested differences in seed production for statistical signiﬁcance using Kruskal–Wallis analysis. Results: Eriosyce subgibbosa showed a distinctive pollinator assemblage among the sympatric species that we studied (similarity ranged from 0\% to 8\%); it was visited by small bees and was the only species that was visited by the giant hummingbird Patagona gigas. Pollinator assemblages were similar between E. chilensis (year 2016 = 4 species; 2017 = 8) and E. chilensis var. albidiﬂora (2016 = 7; 2017 = 4); however, those of E. curvispina var. mutabilis (2016 = 7; 2017 = 6) were less similar to those of the aforementioned species. E. curvispina var. mutabilis showed the highest interannual variation in its pollinator assemblage (18\% similarity). Reproduction in E. subgibbosa largely depends on pollinators, although it showed some degree of autogamy. Autonomous pollination was unfeasible in E. chilensis, which depended on ﬂower visitors for its reproductive success. Both E. chilensis var. albidiﬂora and E. curvispina var. mutabilis showed some degree of autogamy.},

	abstract = {The genus Rhaphithamnus (Verbenaceae) consists of two species, one in South America and another endemic to the Juan Fernández archipelago, Chile. The genus represents an example of anagenetic speciation in which the island populations have diverged from their colonizing ancestors to the point where they are recognized as a distinct species. The island species Rhaphithamnus venustus differs from the continental R. spinosus primarily by ﬂoral traits associated with adaptation to hummingbird pollination. Two molecular markers, ampliﬁed fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and microsatellites, were used to estimate divergence between the continental and insular species, and to compare diversity in the two species. The comparable or greater diversity in the insular species observed in some diversity indices of AFLPs would support the hypothesis that during the course of anagenetic speciation it has recovered from any reduction of genetic diversity associated with colonization of the archipelago. This pattern of comparable or higher diversity in insular species is seen with other instances of anagenetic speciation in the Juan Fernández archipelago. By contrast, the lower genetic diversity in the insular R. venustus found in microsatellites is likely to be the result of a founder effect from the original colonization of the archipelago; prior molecular studies suggest recent colonization of the Juan Fernández archipelago by Rhaphithamnus. The seeming non-concordance between the present results and the widely accepted biogeography of Rhaphithamnus inferred from other data is discussed and an explanation is presented.},

	abstract = {The connectivity of remnant patches of habitat may affect the persistence of species in fragmented landscapes. We evaluated the effects of the structural connectivity of forest patches (i.e., distance between patches) and matrix class (land-cover type) on the functional connectivity of 3 bird species (the White-crested Elaenia [Elaenia albiceps], the Green-backed Firecrown Hummingbird [Sephanoides sephaniodes], and the Austral Thrush [Turdus falklandii]). We measured functional connectivity as the rate at which each species crossed from one patch to another. We also evaluated whether greater functional connectivity translated into greater ecological connectivity (dispersal of fruit and pollen) by comparing among forest patches fruit set of a plant pollinated by hummingbirds and abundance of seedlings and adults of 2 plants with bird- and wind-dispersed seeds. Interpatch distance was strongly associated with functional connectivity, but its effect was not independent of matrix class. For one of the bird-dispersed plants, greater functional connectivity for White-crested Elaenias and Austral Thrushes (both frugivores) was associated with higher densities of this plant. The lack of a similar association for the wind-dispersed species suggests this effect is linked to the dispersal vector. The abundance of the hummingbird-pollinated species was not related to the presence of hummingbirds. Interpatch distance and matrix class affect animal movement in fragmented landscapes and may have a cascading effect on the distribution of some animal-dispersed species. On the basis of our results, we believe effort should be invested in optimizing patch configuration and modifying the matrix so as to mitigate the effects of patch isolation in fragmented landscapes.},

We studied the genetic effects of fragmentation in southern Chile on Embothrium coccineum J.R. et G. Forster, an early colonizing, bird-pollinated tree. We tested the hypothesis that, because of its self-incompatibility and life-history strategy, E. coccineum is less strongly affected by fragmentation. We studied the effects of reduced population size and increased isolation on population genetic structure and early performance of progeny. Samples were collected from spatially isolated trees and six fragments of differing sizes (small, 1 ha; medium, 20 ha; large, {\textgreater}150 ha). Based on isozyme polymorphisms we estimated parameters of genetic diversity, divergence, and inbreeding for adults and greenhouse-grown progeny. We also measured germination, seedling growth, and outcrossing rates on progeny arrays. Genetic variation of adults did not correlate significantly with population size, as expected, given that fragmentation occurred relatively recently. Weak effects of fragmentation were measured on progeny. Only adults yielded significant inbreeding. Similar total genetic diversity was found in adults and progeny. Low but significant genetic differentiation existed among adult and progeny populations. Seedling growth correlated positively with the effective number of alleles, showing deleterious effects of inbreeding on progeny. Seeds from small fragments had the highest outcrossing rates and germination success, indicating that higher pollinator activity in such fragments reduced selfing, thereby buffering genetic erosion and maintaining adaptive variation. The effects of forest fragmentation were detectable in E. coccineum, but these effects will probably not be detrimental to the viability of remnant populations because small, fragmented populations demonstrated higher levels of gene flow and lower inbreeding than larger stands. Pioneer species that are insensitive to forest clearing may be crucial in recovery plans to facilitate the establishment of species intolerant to such disturbance.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Various aspects of the reproductive biology of the Andean-disjunct genus Retanilla (DC.) Brongn. were studied in populations of R. trinervia and R. ephedra located in central Chile and of R. patagonica in southern Argentina. Flowering extends from -austral- winter (early spring in R. patagonica) to early summer. The small, white, entomophilous flowers are incompletely protandrous and last four to five days. A weak pleasant odor along with nectar and pollen attract thirtyseven diurnal insect species, ten of which are probable pollinators: these include the honey bee, eight species of solitary bees pertaining to Anthophoridae (1 sp.), Colletidae (3 spp.) and Halictidae (4 spp.), and a nemestrinid fly. Although flower morphology and individual flower phenology do not fully prevent self-pollination (and geitonogamy can easily take place), the level of autogamy is low. Therefore, some self-incompatibility mechanism seems operative in Retanilla. Fruit set of openpollinated flowers is extremely low, with a maximal value of c. 3\% in R. patagonica. In this species, ripe fruits contain on average 1.37 viable seeds. Predispersal (maternal) reproductive success (percent ovules becoming viable seeds) is 2.3\%. For medium to full-sized individuals this corresponds to c. 4600 potential offspring per year. As presently known, Retanilla is a reproductively uniform group, in which the Andean disjunction seems to have exerted no particular impact, which is consistent with the view that pollination generalization exerts some stabilizing influence on floral morphology and other reproductive traits. Retanilla expresses a basic rhamnacean set of traits (including protandry and self-incompatibility) showing also high pollen production and secondary pollen presentation. The latter two traits seem characteristic of the RetanillaTrevoa clade, suggesting that a trend to increased male effort and, perhaps, dependence upon polleneating has evolved within the tribe Colletieae.},

	abstract = {We conducted a systematic review of the scientiﬁc literature published on plant–pollinator interactions, from both the plant and pollinator perspective, in the Chilean Mediterranean-type ecosystem (MTE hereafter). Our search identiﬁed 69 published papers on 235 native plant species from 62 families. Less than 7.9\% of the ﬂowering species inhabiting the Chilean Mediterranean have been studied, and most studies were restricted to only one locality and one reproductive season. The geographic location of the studies differed from a random pattern, showing two well-deﬁned areas where most studies were conducted. Likewise, most studies in the Andes Range were performed above 2000 m a.s.l. The number of species of ﬂower visitor per plant species was low (4.25 Æ 0.22), which probably results from the historical and biogeographic isolation of Chile. This literature survey shows that studies relating ﬂoral traits with pollinator attraction and plant reproduction are the most frequent topics of research, reaching 37.6\% of studies, followed by studies that examine pollination in relation to human impact (16.1\%), micro- and macroevolution (14.0\%), relationships between pollination and other ecological interactions (10.8\%), community and network assessments (11.8\%), and effects of abiotic variables on pollination interactions (9.7\%). Our review highlights a lack of research on the effects of pollination for anthropogenic land use especially as agricultural practice is one of the most salient features of the Chilean MTE. Future directions to increase our understanding of the role of plant–pollinator relationships for biodiversity maintenance should include: to extend the taxonomic and geographic scope of research, to increase the number of spatial and temporal replicates, to increase the number of studies on pollination networks as they provide estimates of community complexity and putative stability, to develop studies that estimate the importance of pollination for plant demographic parameters and conservation, and to conduct studies that estimate the ecological service provided by Chilean native pollinators for crop yield and sustainable agriculture.},

	abstract = {Pollination syndromes are deﬁned as suites of ﬂoral traits evolved in response to selection imposed by a particular group of pollinators (e.g., butterﬂies, hummingbirds, bats). Although numerous studies demonstrated their occurrence in plants pollinated by radically different pollinators, it is less known whether it is possible to identify them within species pollinated by one functional pollinator group. In such a framework, we expect ﬂoral traits to evolve also in response to pollinator subgroups (e.g., species, genera) within that unique functional group. On this, specialised pollination systems represent appropriate case studies to test such expectations. Calceolaria is a highly diversiﬁed plant genus pollinated by oil-collecting bees in genera Centris and Chalepogenus. Variation in ﬂoral traits in Calceolaria has recently been suggested to reﬂect adaptations to pollinator types. However, to date no study has explicitly tested that observation. In this paper, we quantitatively test that hypothesis by evaluating the presence of pollination syndromes within the specialised pollination system formed by several Calceolaria and their insect pollinators. To do so, we use multivariate approaches and explore the structural matching between the morphology of 10 Calceolaria taxa and that of their principal pollinators. Our results identify morphological matching between ﬂoral traits related to access to the reward and insect traits involved in oil collection, conﬁrming the presence of pollinator syndromes in Calceolaria. From a general perspective, our ﬁndings indicate that the pollination syndrome concept can be also extended to the intra-pollinator group level.},

Habitat fragmentation can affect the morphological design of flying insects in different ways through changes in the costs and benefits of dispersal patterns. Larger wings should be favored if necessary resources are scattered across a fragmented landscape. The purpose of this research is to test this prediction in Bombus dahlbomii (Guérin), a native Chilean pollinator associated with the fragmented Maulino forest. We used hanging traps to collect individuals in the continuous native forest, in four small forest remnants and in two Pinus radiata plantations (matrix). We measured the body size (mm) and the length of the first and the second pairs of wings (mm) of each individual collected. In all, 280 individuals were captured. The body size and the length of both the first and the second pairs of wings were higher in the forest fragments and the matrix than in the continuous forest. A significant positive relationship between wing length and body size was observed for all habitats, but the percentage of variance explained was lower in the continuous forest than in the fragments and the matrix. These results suggest that the fragmentation of the Maulino forest would favor phenotypes with larger wings. It is probable that these phenotypes would be best at flying and obtaining scarce resources during foraging.},

	abstract = {Determination of suitable zones for apitourism using multi-criteria evaluation in geographic information systems: a case study in the O’Higgins Region, Chile. Cien. Inv. Agr. 44(2): 139-153. Beekeeping, which involves honey production and pollination of agricultural crops, has become a significant production activity. Linking beekeeping with ecotourism brings greater value to the beekeeping sector, thereby attracting the development of apitourism. Multi-criteria decision analysis is a set of techniques developed through Geographic Information Systems (GIS) focused on spatial decision making, which can be used to link beekeeping and tourism for the development of priority sites for shared activity. This work is based on the definition and weighting of factors used for evaluation of apitourism suitability in Chile, considering the opinion of beekeepers and professionals associated with the sector. The result is a map of apitouristic suitability that includes vegetation, tourism, precipitation, temperature, roads, rivers and genetically modified crops (GM crops), as well as three restrictions: soil use, highways and wild areas protected by the state. The model allowed the localization of priority sites for resources and efforts pertaining to the development of apitourism.},

	abstract = {Since its introduction in Chile, the European Bombus terrestris L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) has progressively reduced the abundance of the native Patagonian bumblebee, Bombus dahlbomii Gue´ rin. Because an important cause of successful invasion of a species may depend on a potentially advantageous phenotype, we studied morphologies related to ﬂight performance (ﬂight muscle ratio (FMR), wing loading (WL), excess power index (EPI, which integrates FMR and WL) and wing aspect ratio (AR)) in the queens of the two species. Previous empirical studies showed that greater FMR, AR and EPI, and lower WL increase ﬂight performance. In the Patagonian Chilean fjord where the study was carried out, B. dahlbomii was 40\% heavier than B. terrestris, a difference theoretically allowing the queens of the native species to take off with heavier loads, despite the fact that the two species have virtually identical FMRs. However, FMR negatively depended on body mass at the intra-speciﬁc level. The total wing area was 35\% greater in B. dahlbomii, but the difference in forewing length was only of 16\%. Once taken into account the effect of body size, WL, was signiﬁcantly lower in B. terrestris. AR increased with body mass and did not differ between species. EPI was weakly but signiﬁcantly higher in B. terrestris. Experiments formally linking such parameters with ﬂight performance may help to explain the observed quick and wide spread of this alien species in Patagonia in the last few years. ß 2014 Acade´ mie des sciences.

During the 1999/2000 season, the distribution, relative abundance and size of the proboscis were recorded. Both species are widely distributed in the Region, with a relative abundance of 58.8\% and 41.2\%, respectively. A greater pollinating activity could be observed in the morning and evening intervals, with B. ruderatus being more active in visiting a greater number of flowers and spending more time than B. dahlbomi. A preference of this latter species was observed for higher native plants, while B. ruderatus preferred herbaceous and exotic plants. The mean size of the proboscis was 9.86 mm for B. dahlbomi and 9.77 mm for B. ruderatus, concluding that both bumblebees belong to the group of Bombus with a long proboscis, able to pollinate flowers with deep corollas such as red clover.},

This paper is the first approximation of the abundance of pollinator species associated with Eucalyptus nitens in a Clonal seed-bank plantation (CSBP) of the farm “Rucamanqui”, Huepil, Biobío Region in Chile. Between October and November 2010, we examined the variation of pollinator’s entomofauna of E. nitens. Environmental factors, such as temperature and the number of open flowers per plant, were registered to determine the level of dependence on the frequency of visits. The most abundant insects visiting E. nitens belonged to the orders Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera. However, the proportion of individuals in each group of flower visitors varied considerably among the sampling months: Hymenoptera (203), Coleoptera (21) in October and Coleoptera (280), Hymenoptera (57) in November. For Hymenoptera, environmental temperature was significant compared to frequency of visitors; whereas for Coleoptera, the number of open flowers per plant has been significant for insect activity. Results show that the visit frequency of pollinators in E. nitens is highly variable within the sampling period and temperature and density of open flowers per plant can produce variations within the group of pollinators.},

	abstract = {During the period of peak flowering of the Proteaceous tree Embothrium coccineum Forst. in the temperate forests of Chiloé Island, in southern Chile (42°30'S), nine bird species, eight Passerines, one Psittaciforme, consume nectar from its flowers. The major nectar-feeding bird visiting the flowers of E. coccineum (77\% of all the visits by birds in 242 periods of 30 minutes each, in November 1992 and 1993) was the Tyrannid Elaenia albiceps, which had been described earlier as insectivore and frugivore. The hummingbird, Sephanoides galeritus (12\% of the visits), and the Passerines Carduelis barbatus (5.6\%) and Phrygilus patagonicus (5\%) followed in importance. The remaining five bird species accounted for {\textless}1\% of the visits each. E. albiceps frequently establishes territories in flowering Embothrium trees, actively expelling other visiting birds. The flowers of E. coccineum secrete 16 ȝO of nectar daily, with an average supply of 6. 9 calories. Flowers can secrete nectar more than once in a day and have an average life span of four days. The energy supply of a flower during its life span is comparable to that of sorne fleshy fruits consumed by birds in the same area. We showed that both the hummingbird and E. albiceps carry polOen of E. coccineum in their bodies and hence these species are the pollinators of this tree. S. galeritus visits a larger number of flowers in each flight than E. albiceps, but the latter bird carries three times as many pollen grains and is a more specific visitor of the flowers of E. coccineum. The relative concentrations of sacarose and hexoses in the nectar of E. coccineum flowers are intermediate between the values described for the nectar of flowers pollinated primarily or exclusively by hummingbirds in the Neotropics (with predominance of sacarose) and those of flowers pollinated by other birds or insects (with predominance of hexoses).},

Visits to ﬂowers by nectar-feeding birds were recorded during 30-min observation periods, spread throughout the day during two ﬂowering seasons, November 1992 and 1993 (n = 242 periods overall). Aggressive encounters among ﬂower visitors were recorded in 1992. We expected less visits to trees in pastures and small forest patches because abundances of Embothrium’s main pollinators, the ﬂycatcher Elaenia albiceps and the hummingbird Sephanoides sephaniodes, decreased in smaller patches. We found, however, that pollinator visiting rates were negatively correlated with forest patch area and were highest for pasture trees. This trend was largely due a decline in the number of visits by E. albiceps, the main ﬂower visitor, in larger patches. Hummingbird visits did not change with forest patch size. Lower visitation rates to ﬂowering trees in larger forest fragments seemed to be a consequence of territorial defence by E. albiceps and were unrelated to differences in ﬂoral display.},

The breeding system, phenology, morphology and floral longevity of C. chilensis were studied in a natural population located at Aucó, Reserva Nacional Las Chinchillas, IV Región, Chile. A controlled pollination experiment was carried out considering the following treatments: natural pollination, cross-pollination, manual self-pollination, automatic self-pollination and apomixis, evaluating their effect on fruit formation and seed number per fruit. In addition, we evaluated the following traits of the progeny according to pollination type (selfing or outcrossing): seed weight, germination and seedling height and number of leaves after eight weeks of germination under green house conditions. We found Convolvulus chilensis is self-compatible, partially autogamous (capable of selfing without a pollinator agent) and partially apomictic (capable of producing seeds without male gamet). The floral longevity was estimated in 5.25 h During this period, the pollen on the stamens is available only during 1.5 h. The blooming period lasted for 22 weeks (August to January). The apomixis treatment showed a lower fruit set and seed number per flower than natural, cross and self-pollination treatments, which did not show any difference between them in both traits. Pollination type (selfing or outcrossing) did not affect progeny performance in terms of the evaluated seed and seedling traits.},

	abstract = {Rhaphithamnus Miers. (Verbenaceae) consists of two species restricted to southern South America. Rhaphithamnus spinosus (A. L. Juss.) Mold. occurs in mainland Chile and adjacent Argentina; R. venustus (philippi) Robinson is endemic to the two islands (Masatierra and Masafuera) of the Juan Fernandez Archipelago. Both species are related to Citharexylum Miller, a genus distributed from Peru northward along the Andes. Youthful geological ages of the Juan Fernandez Islands (1-4 myr) and occurrences of the sister group also on the con.tinent suggest that R. venustus evolved from R. spinosus rather than the reverse. Morphologically the two species differ primarily in corolla length and color and stem armament, with R. spinosus with shorter (ca. 12 mm) and bluish flowers and usually with axillary thorns in contrast to longer (ca. 25 mm) and purple flowers and lack of thorns for R. venustus. Studies of pollinators reveal bees, flies, beetles, and infrequently hummingbirds for R. spinosus and exclusively hummingbirds for R. venustus. Rhaphithamnus spinosus is hermaphroditic and partially self-compatible, whereas R. venustus is gynodioecious and with an unknown compatibility system. In the latter species female flowers appear to be in an early stage of evolution because anthers are still fully formed, but usually without pollen grains. Embryological studies reveal breakdown of pollen mother cells (and tapetal cells) during meiosis. We hypothesize that evolution of floral features in R. venustus is a result of a change from primarily insect to hummingbird pollination; loss of thorns may result from absence of herbivores in the Islands. Gynodioecy in Rhaphithamnus may have as its selective basis reduction of inbreeding depression otherwise brought on by geitonogamy in scattered individuals of small populations.},

Escallonia myrtoidea exhibits floral traits associated with pollination by diurnal butterflies; however, flowers remain open during the night and, thus, may also be pollinated by nocturnal moths. We assessed frequency of pollinator visits and pollination success in flowers exposed to diurnal and nocturnal pollinators in a factorial design. We also assessed pollinator dependency and limitations for seed set through hand self- and hand cross-pollination tests. Flowers were visited mainly by bees rather than by butterflies or moths. Neither diurnal nor nocturnal pollinators had any effect on seed set over the seed set of alwaysbagged inflorescences, while hand cross-pollinated flowers produced significantly more seeds than hand self-pollinated flowers or flowers exposed to diurnal and/or nocturnal pollinators. Thus, E. myrtoidea, a tree strongly pollinator-limited for seed setting, exhibited a lack of coupling among floral traits, pollinators, and reproductive success.},

Mutualists (e.g., pollinators) and antagonists (e.g., herbivores) can exert non-additive effects on plant fitness, which is interpreted as evidence of a pathway for correlated evolution on mutualist- and antagonist-linked traits, respectively. We suggest that a decrease in pollination and herbivory due to habitat fragmentation and proximity to edges may lead plants to face non-correlated fitness effects (i.e., additivity) exerted by pollinators and herbivores. We assessed the effects of pollinators and herbivores on Bomarea salsilla seed set by separately and simultaneously excluding pollinators and herbivores in a fully factorial design. The exclusions were performed in the core and edge of a continuous forest, and in the core and edge of forest fragments. At all sites studied, pollinators, but not herbivores, affected plant fitness, exerting non-correlated fitness effects. Consequently, forest fragmentation and the creation of edge habitats seemed not to affect the pollinator- and herbivore-mediated selection pressures on B. salsilla.},

Nevertheless, the probability of a plant to be robbed will ultimately depend upon the accessibility constraints imposed by the phenotypes of ﬂowers and animals, and putatively upon the abundance of animals. The alien bumblebee B. terrestris is widely distributed in the temperate forests of Chile, where it is exerting nectar robbing on ﬂowers of F. magellanica. Its geographic distribution and the causes of nectar robbing, however, are currently unknown. The aim of this study is to evaluate the distribution of nectar robbing in a wide range of distribution of plants and animals, and the causes of nectar robbing in terms of ﬂoral and animal phenotypes, and in terms of animal abundances. The primary nectar robbing did not correlate with the latitude, longitude or altitude of populations, thus indicating an absence of cline variation in the causes of nectar robbing. The variability of primary nectar robbing seemingly showed a bimodal distribution, since the most represented categories were the low and high incidence of primary nectar robbing. Petal length, rather than other ﬂora traits, coupled to the glossa length of animals, played a pivotal role in the probability of ﬂowers to experience nectar robbing. The putative negative consequences upon the population persistence and the evolution and maintenance of ﬂoral phenotypes of hummingbird-pollinated plants strongly encourage new assessments.},

	doi = {10.1093/cz/zox050},
	abstract = {The study of multi-modal communication has only recently been extended to innate and learned interactions between flowers and their animal visitors, and usually only to pollinators. Here we studied the relevance of floral scent and visual display of a night blooming, putatively hawkmoth-pollinated plant Oenothera acaulis (Onagraceae) in the attraction of non-native cockroaches Blatta orientalis (Blattodea: Blattidae), which function as facultative floral larcenists in coastal habitats of central Chile. We experimentally decoupled visual (corolla) and olfactory (fragrance) stimuli by presenting paper corollas and green mesh bags, with or without a freshly-picked natural flower inside. We then contrasted the behavioral responses of roaches in these treatments with those to the natural combination of traits in actual flowers and their respective control treatments, measuring the roaches’ frequency of first visits, mean and total residence time spent in each treatment. The roaches primarily used olfactory cues when approaching O. acaulis flowers at two biologically relevant spatial scales. In addition, the presence of conspecific roaches had a strong influence on recruitment to the experimental arena, increasing the statistical differences among treatments. Our results suggest a primacy of floral fragrance over visual stimuli in the foraging responses of B. orientalis. Olfactory cues were necessary and sufficient to attract the roaches, and the visual cues presented in our manipulations only marginally increased their attraction within a 20 cm diameter of the stimulus. The full spectrum of floral visitation behavior was not elicited by the artificial flowers, suggesting the need for additional tactile or contact chemosensory stimuli not provided by paper. Although the nitrogenous scent compounds that we found in O. acaulis flowers are almost exclusively found in hawkmoth-pollinated flowers, the attractiveness of these compounds to a non-native, facultative flower-visiting insect indicates that they do not function as pollinator-specific signals for hawkmoth attraction [Current Zoology 57 (2): 162–174, 2011].},

Effects of spatial buffers from 0.5 to 8 km around each blueberry field on the abundance of the main wild pollinator, Bombus terrestris queens, were tested. Wild B. terrestris abundances were positively affected by natural forest area and negatively affected by high-food resource area, and these effects were strongest at a buffer radius of 1 and 3.5 km, respectively. Possibly, continuous food resources provided by natural forest areas favor colony establishment and growth, and/or increase overwintering survival of bumblebee queens. Also, pollinator dependent crop area can generate a Btransient dilution effect{\textasciicircum} by decreasing the density of bumblebees in simultaneously flowering crops. Management strategies might increase crop pollination services by considering the importance of nesting and overwintering habitat quality/amount and area of simultaneously flowering crops requiring insect pollination.},

	abstract = {The hyperarid Atacama Desert of northern Chile may be the driest place on Earth. Plants surviving there have adapted a number of unique strategies to cope with the harsh conditions. Many cacti in arid areas tend to produce reproductive organs in positions that maximize incidence of solar radiation. We sought to determine whether Eulychnia acida, an endemic cactus with an arborescent growth form, follows the same pattern. We conducted a study in two populations of the cactus. One population occurs where average annual precipitation (AAP) is 113 mm; AAP at the other site is 50 mm. We randomly sampled 10 plants at each location, and 300 reproductive structures on those plants. On each plant, we recorded the position of all reproductive organs relative to the center of the plant, and relative to the center of the stems on which they were located. The results of the two populations did not differ signiﬁcantly, so results of the two populations were combined. Both populations lie south of the Tropic of Capricorn, beyond the point where the sun reaches its southernmost zenith. Hence, the sun is located at to the north all year long. We discovered that the reproductive tissue emerges predominantly on stems found the equatorial (north) side of the plant and on the equatorial (north) side of those stems. As reproduction is energetically expensive, the generation of reproductive organs from vegetative tissue that receives high levels of direct solar radiation minimizes the cost of translocating photosynthates from photosynthetic tissue to non-photosynthetic reproductive tissue, thus begetting energetic efﬁciency. The strategy appears to be common among many cacti and in some other plants of arid regions worldwide and is especially prevalent at extra-tropical latitudes. In addition to nectar rewards, the strategy may also beneﬁt pollinators by offering a thermal reward, especially on overcast or otherwise cool days, thus improving the odds of successful pollination.},

	abstract = {The component Allee effect has been deﬁned as ‘a positive relationship between any measure of individual ﬁtness and the number or density of conspeciﬁcs’. Larger plant populations or large patches have shown a higher pollinator visitation rate, which may give rise to an Allee effect in reproduction of the plants. We experimentally tested the effect of number of conspeciﬁcs on reproduction and pollinator visitation in Eschscholzia californica Cham., an invasive plant in Chile. We then built patches with two, eight and 16 ﬂowering individuals of E. californica (11 replicates per treatment) in an area characterised by dominance of the study species. We found that E. californica exhibits a component Allee effect, as the number of individuals of this species has a positive effect on individual seed set. However, individual fruit production was not affected by the number of plants examined. Pollinator visitation rate was also independent of the number of plants, so this factor would not explain the Allee effect. This rate was positively correlated with the total number of ﬂowers in the patches. We also found that the number of plants did not affect the seed mass or proportion of germinated seeds in the patches. Higher pollen availability in patches with 16 plants and pollination by wind could explain the Allee effect. The component Allee effect identiﬁed could lead to a weak demographic Allee effect that might reduce the rate of spread of E. californica. Knowledge of this would be useful for management of this invasive plant in Chile.},

To answer this question, we compared the population distribution of display sizes with the distribution of visited display sizes at two sites. Six high elevation butterflies: Faunula leucoglene (Satyridae) (the dominant species), Hylephila sp. (Hesperiidae), Phulia nymphula (Pieridae), Vanessa terpsichore (Nymphalidae), Tatochila mercedis (Nymphalidae), and Yramea modesta (Nymphalidae) were reported as visitors. Butterflies tended to discriminate against plants with a single open head, preferring larger display sizes at both sites. Butterflies visited few plants per bout (mean: 3.1–4.5) and probed increasingly smaller proportions of the open heads per plant with increasing display size (overall mean: 45.8–48.4\%). Results suggest that high elevation butterflies tend to prefer larger display sizes over smaller ones, but final choices are conditioned by the relative abundance of each display size in a population. Although previous studies show that butterflies prefer larger artificial individual flowers over smaller ones, our work appears to constitute the first report of butterfly preference for larger floral displays in any plant species or ecosystem.},

Stigma-anther reciprocity (2 populations), morph representation (7 populations), unassisted selfing capacity and open-pollination fruit set (6 populations) were determined. O. compacta ssp. compacta es highly dependent on external pollinators. Although it has typical tristylous flowers, considerable seed set is possible following illegitimate intermorph and intramorph cross pollination. Open pollination fruit set varied from 9-83\% and on average was lower in the higher-elevation populations. The possibility of seed set following two kinds of illegitimate cross pollination is seen as a means of enhancing reproductive output by enabling more effective use of the limited pollinator resource in the high alpine environment, where fruit set shows high inter-annual variability and there is some evidence for pollination limitation in Oxalis compacta subsp. compacta.},

The importance of stability process for nectar guide characters that signal ﬂoral reward has not been considered in the literature. In principle, ﬂowers with symmetrical guides should be more successful at attracting pollinators, therefore increasing their reproductive success in comparison to asymmetrical ﬂowers. In this paper we test this hypothesis in a population of 171 individuals of the Andean monkey ﬂower, Mimulus luteus in northern Chile. This species shows a conspicuous red spot in the landing yellow petal, which permits assessment of the functional relationship between nectar guide FA and female ﬁtness. Our results did not reveal a signiﬁcant linear nor nonlinear relationship between nectar guide FA and ﬁtness. This result was consistent after controlling the level of FA by guide and corolla size. Because the corolla of M. luteus did not show evidence of UV wavelength reﬂectance, our negative result could not be attributable to a confounding effect of UV guides. Even though we can not rule out that nectar guide FA correlates better with male than female ﬁtness, the low fraction of the variance in female ﬁtness accounted for nectar guide FA, suggests that other components of the ﬂoral phenotype as well as environmental factors may be more important to predict pollinator preference and reproductive success in this species.},

However, this effect of attraction does not necessarily occur in a binary way, all-or-nothing. Loasa tricolor KerGawl. is an annual herb covered with stinging hairs. Flowers present a corolla with five yellow petals and red nectarine scales. In this study, we assess whether the variation in the floral phenotype of L. tricolor affects discrimination by pollinators, following a dose-dependent type of response. This study was carried out in a protected area of Chile where L. tricolor shows high levels of florivory, probably affecting its attraction to pollinators. We experimentally modified the corolla phenotype, removing three or all petals. We measured visitation rate, richness and diversity of pollinator species in treated and control flowers. Results show that three-petal-removal did not reduce the visitation rate compared to control, while complete-petal-removal significantly reduced the visitation rate. Most pollinator species were recorded in the three-petal-removal treatment (nine species), while complete-petal-removal treatment obtained the lowest richness value (four species). These results suggest that species diversity, richness and visitation rates are affected by flower phenotype variation, but probably for complete petal loss only. We suggest that different levels of florivory on L. tricolor do not affect pollinator discrimination in a dose-dependent way.},

However, populations may evolve a diverse variety of strategies depending on the ecological context of pollination. In this study we examined the pollination environment, inbreeding depression, and herkogamy of Mimulus luteus (Phrymaceae) in two consecutive years in an attempt to evaluate the extent to which these factors determine the current level of autogamy in this population. Results indicate that pollinators were almost absent in the study site in 2005 and 2006. Likewise, no evidence of signiﬁcant inbreeding depression for seed production and seed germination was detected in the 2 years. Because M. luteus presents hermaphrodite ﬂowers with ‘movement herkogamy’ (touch-sensitive stigmata that close upon contact), and anther–stigma separation, we evaluated the role of these traits in self-fertilization. First, we assessed the effects of pollen source (self- and xenogamous pollen, and control solution) on stigmata dynamics after pollen deposition, and seed production. We observed that stigmata that received pollen (self- and xenogamous hand-pollinated) remained closed for a longer time than ﬂowers that received no pollen (control ﬂowers). Seed production, however, was unaffected by pollen source, indicating that movement herkogamy does not prevent self-fertilization in this population. Second, a phenotypic selection analysis revealed that seed production increased with a reduction of anther–stigma separation in absence of pollinators (bagged ﬂowers), suggesting that low herkogamy levels are promoted in this population. Our results indicate that lack of inbreeding depression, ineffective movement herkogamy, and selection against anther–stigma separation are factors that may contribute to the prevalence of autogamous reproductive mechanisms when M. luteus faces environments with scarce mating opportunity.},

Methods: The presence of HP was studied in native plants growing with and without co-existence with the exotic E. vulgare. A complementary hand pollination experiment was carried out to assess whether E. vulgare pollen reduced the reproductive success of native plants. 15
Results: In the presence of E. vulgare, 17.3\% and 3.7\% of P. secunda and S. albicaulis individuals that coexisted with the exotic species received HP. For P. secunda, the number of conspeciﬁc pollen grains decreased in invaded patches compared with non-invaded patches; no differences were observed for S. albicaulis. The pollen of E. vulgare negatively affected the reproductive success of S. albicaulis but not that of P. secunda.
Conclusions: The presence of HP cannot be predicted from the presence of exotic plants alone, and other factors, such as 20},

The annual species Madia sativa (Asteraceae) exhibits ample variation in the number of ray ﬂorets in natural populations. This ﬁeld study aimed at evaluating the costs and beneﬁts associated with ﬂoral traits in M. sativa. In particular, we addressed two main questions: (1) Is the number of ray ﬂorets positively associated with pollinator visitation rate? (2) Is there a ﬁtness cost of ray ﬂoret maintenance when pollinators are absent? We detected one beneﬁt of conspicuous ray capitula: a strong preference by insect pollinators. We also conﬁrmed the occurrence of costs: when pollinators were excluded conspicuous ray capitula had a reduced reproductive assurance via autogamous selﬁng, and there were trade-offs between the number of ray ﬂorets and seed mass and seed germination. Results suggest that the maintenance of within-population variation in the number of ray ﬂorets in M. sativa is explained, at least in part, by the balance between costs and beneﬁts associated with this ﬂoral trait.},

The change in pollinator assemblages, due to habitat modiﬁcation, may modify the impact of ﬂower herbivory on plant reproductive success. In this work, we evaluate the effect of ﬂower herbivory on the seed production of Viola portalesia (Gay) in two contrasting environments, a native and low-disturbed habitat and an extensively transformed habitat characterized by Pinus radiata plantations. Even though the two habitats differed substantially in the composition of pollinator assemblages and visitation rate, the ﬂower damage performed on different petals had no impact on seed production neither within nor between habitats, indicating that change in pollinator assemblages have no indirect reproductive impact via discrimination of damaged ﬂowers. There was a strong habitat effect, however, for seed production, being higher in the pine plantation than in the native habitat. Seed production on a per ﬂower basis increased at a higher rate with the number of ﬂowers in the pine plantation, which suggests a numerical response of pollinators to changes in food availability in this habitat.},

	abstract = {Pollen limitation (PL) in plant populations is supposed to be particularly strong in variable pollinator environments. Here, we examined the extent of PL in the coastal Atacama Desert, where low and unpredictable rainfall drives large interannual variation in plant cover and pollinator abundances. We estimated PL levels and the capacity for autonomous selﬁng (autofertility) in 16 annual and perennial species. In addition, we compared fruit set of emasculated and intact ﬂowers to test whether selﬁng provides reproductive assurance. We also examined the relationships between autofertility and life forms, between PL and autofertility, and between PL and ﬂower size. We found a low level of PL (mean ¼ 0:28) and a high incidence of autofertility, which was negatively correlated with PL and closely related to life form. Our results suggest that the low PL levels in autonomous-selﬁng species result from the reproductive assurance provided by selﬁng. Considering nonautonomous species only, the mean PL (0.44) was similar to that reported for other habitats. We detected no association between PL and ﬂower size. In summary, high rates of PL were not a general pattern among plants in the Atacama Desert. The low levels of PL can be attributed to the high incidence of autofertility.},

The genus Chloraea (Orchidaceae) has its main center of diversity in southern South America. There is only poor knowledge concerning its breeding system and pollination. We determined the breeding system of C. crispa, C. chrysantha, C. galeata, and two color forms of C. bletioides (yellow- and white-ﬂowered forms). None of the species in this study produced fruits through apomixis or autogamy, thereby indicating a complete dependency on pollen and pollinators. Geitogamy did not differ signiﬁcantly with respect to xenogamy excepting in the yellow-ﬂowered form of C. bletioides. Thus, the indexes of self-incompatibility for the white- and yellow-ﬂowered forms of C. bletioides, C. galeata, C. crispa, and C. chrysantha, were 1.00, 0.56, 0.82, 1.09, and 0.81, respectively; indicating that, excluding the yellow-ﬂowered form of C. bletioides which must be regarded as partially selfincompatible, all orchids assessed are totally self-compatible plants. Natural fruiting in the yellow-ﬂowered C. bletioides, C. chrysantha and C. galeata was high, in spite of being nectarless orchids, since the availability of pollinators under natural conditions seemingly resulted unlimited. However, no pollinator was observed visiting C. chrysantha and C. galeata, whereas the yellow-ﬂowered form of C. bletioides was visited by hymenopterans and coleopterans. At contrast, reproductive success of the white-ﬂowered form of C. bletioides and C. crispa was pollen limited, the former being visited by hymenopterans, dipterans, and colepterans; and the latter by two hymenopterans. r 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

The reproductive characteristics of Nastanthus spathulatus (Calyceraceae) and Rhodophiala rhodolirion (Amaryllidaceae), species with contrasting ﬂoral morphology, were studied in the high Andes of Chile, which has a Mediterranean-type climate. Natural and supplemental open pollination, and cross pollination and self-pollination trials were carried out in the ﬁeld. Flower visitors were quantiﬁed by ﬁeld and video observations. Both species had high outcrossing properties, and Nastanthus was strongly self-incompatible. Rhodophiala could form some seed by self-pollination, but fruit and seed sets were much lower after self-pollination compared with outcrossing. The phenology and ﬂower/inﬂorescence forms of these species supported the view that alpine ﬂowers are comparatively long lived and that the ﬂoral display contributes to a large proportion of the plant biomass. Rhodophiala was well attended by a native bee species (Megachile sauleyi) that was appropriately sized for efﬁcient pollination. Although no ﬂower visitors were observed on Nastanthus and wind pollination was discarded experimentally, a high proportion of the ﬂowers produced seeds under natural pollination. Therefore, the seed set was not severely pollen limited in these species. Including previously published information, breeding systems are now known for 12 species on this Mediterranean alpine site and current knowledge suggests an emphasis on outcrossing breeding systems.},

Although similar proportions of G. keule trees flowered in the agricultural and native forest areas, more trees in the agricultural sites produced fruit compared to trees in the native forest sites. Flowering and fruiting of G. keule was extremely rare in the exotic pine plantations. Our data show that G. keule flowers are predominantly visited by syrphid flies in March-April, and that syrphids carry a greater proportion of G. keule pollen than the other insects collected.

Models investigating impacts of habitat fragmentation on pollen ﬂow have categorized landscapes simply in terms of habitat and nonhabitat. We show that pollen ﬂow depends strongly on types of land use between habitat fragments. We used paternity analysis of seeds and a combination of circuit and general linear models to analyze pollen ﬂow for the endangered tree Gomortega keule (Gomortegaceae) [12] in the fragmented Central Chile Biodiversity Hotspot [13]. Pollination probability was highest over pine plantation, moderate over lowintensity agriculture and native forest, and lowest over clearfells. Changing the proportions of the land uses over one kilometer altered pollination probability up to 7-fold. We explain our results by the novel ‘‘Circe principle.’’ In contrast to models where land uses similar to native habitat promote pollinator movement, pollinators may actually be waylaid in resource-rich areas between habitat patches. Moreover, pollinators may move with higher probability between habitat patches separated by some resource-poor land uses. Pollination research in fragmented landscapes requires explicit recognition of the nature of the nonhabitat matrix, rather than applying simple binary landscape models.},

In this paper, analysis of floral morphology, incompatibility relations and population structure show that O.squamata possesses morphological and functional tristyly. The three floral morphs differ in calyx and corolla length. style and stamen length. pollen grain size and stylar pubescence. Results of hand pollinations showed the presence of a strong incompatibility system. legitimate pollinations with the land M morphs as seed parents produced approximately equal numbers of seeds per pollination. The S morph produced less than half the number of seeds per legitimate pollination compared to the other two morphs. Intra- and intermorph illegitimate pollinations produce almost no seeds. Morph representation in the population was isoplethic. Fruit and seed production did not differ significantly for the three morphs in the population. Comparison of experimental and natural production of fruits and seeds suggests that seed set in the natural population may be pollen-limited for the land M morphs.},

	abstract = {Mimulus luteus (Scrophulariaceae) is a perennial herb occurring in the South American Andes that shows a wide variation in the size and shape of a red spot on the lower lobe of the yellow ﬂower. We describe the preference of four insects (three bees and one butterﬂy) and one hummingbird species for ﬂoral characters, and estimated the strength, direction, and form of pollinator-mediated selection through female ﬁtness. We applied geometric morphometrics to describe the preference of pollinator species for different guide shapes. Our results revealed striking differences in the ﬂoral phenotypes preferred by insects and hummingbirds. Insects visited ﬂowers with corollas 1.25-fold larger and guides 1.72fold larger than the hummingbird species did. While insects preferred ﬂowers with nectar guides pointing toward the corolla tube, the hummingbird preferred ﬂowers with heartshaped nectar guides. Most of the ﬂoral preferences shown by pollinators translated into signiﬁcant linear and nonlinear selection coefﬁcients. When selection was analyzed on a per-ﬂower basis and for female ﬁtness, corolla size was under positive directional selection, and nectar guide size and shape were under disruptive selection. Because the insect and hummingbird pollinators showed a strong segregation in their daily activity time, we suggest that current disruptive selection on the nectar guide phenotype can result from the differential availability of the rewarding ﬂoral variants over a day. Our ﬁndings suggest that pollinator-mediated selection favoring extreme phenotypes in M. luteus may not only contribute to high nectar guide variation found in this species, but also can promote divergence of corolla and nectar guide traits.},

	abstract = {The size, form and color are signals used by flowers to attract their pollinators. Large and showy color flowers usually receive higher pollinators visitation rates. According to the optimal forage theory, pollinators would tend to visit flower patches where they obtain the maximum reward regarding the energy expenditure in flower search. In high density patches, flowers are very close each other, hence, flower discrimination by pollinators would tend to be low. In low density patches, however, where the forage effort is greater, larger flowers are usually associated with higher rewards and would receive higher pollinators visitation achieving greater fitness than co-especifics with smaller flowers. In the present study we assessed the effects of flower density and size on the reproductive success (RS) of Nothoscordum gramineum. Four patches of different densities were delimited and the flowers size of the half of individuals at each patch was manually reduced. Results showed that RS was significantly greater in individuals with larger flowers. Additionally, density has a positive effect on RS, especially in large size flowers. Nevertheless, fruition success reached maximum values in patches of intermediate density. Individuals with cut flowers did not varied the RS with the variation of the density, suggesting that flower size is the most important attribute measured as advertisement by pollinators in N. gramineum. Our results do not support the hypothesis that in high density patches, flower displays have low importance.},

In northern hemisphere alpine environments, the reproductive output of several insectpollinated plants has been reported to be pollen-limited. Using a supplemental handpollination experiment, we assessed the magnitude of pollen limitation (PL) in the obligate outcrossing insect-pollinated shrub Chuquiraga oppositifolia in the lower alpine scrub vegetation belt in the central Chilean Andes. We also assessed spatial variation in its reproductive success by comparing seed production among three additional sites. Hand-pollination resulted in a two- to three-fold increase in seed output above natural levels, thus demonstrating PL in this species. Nevertheless, percentage seed output remained low, increasing from 2.0 to 5.7\%. Seed weight was reduced by 15\% in hand-pollinated plants. Seed output was also low in the three additional sites, but did not differ among them, suggesting that low seed output is a spatially widespread phenomenon in this species. Our results, together with previous research, suggest that both pollinator visitation and abiotic resources (soil nutrients) constrain the reproductive output of this shrub. Longer-term research should unravel potential future vegetative and reproductive costs of current-year enhanced reproductive output and determine if PL is a recurrent phenomenon in the Chilean Andes.},

	abstract = {To assess whether ﬂoral integration patterns result from the action of pollinator selection on functionally related traits, we compared corolla integration patterns in eight Schizanthus species differing in pollination systems and in their degree of pollinator dependence across a molecular phylogeny. Integration patterns differed among species and these differences were not related to their phylogenetic relatedness. When the putative original function of some corolla traits was lost in pollinator-dependent species, the integration among nonfunctional characters and the rest of the corolla traits was disrupted. This pattern was not presented in species adapted for late autonomous selﬁng, which exhibited higher corolla integration than their pollinator-dependent relatives. These results suggest that corolla integration in pollinator-dependent species was shaped by pollinator-mediated selection. Decoupling of nonfunctional traits in these species may result from a relaxation of correlational selection or from selection acting against a default covariation provided by genetic and developmental connections.},

Schizanthus hookeri has a bee pollination syndrome and is strongly dependent on pollinators for seed set. In contrast, S. grahamii has a hummingbird pollination syndrome and exhibits late autonomous selﬁng. Southern populations of the latter species have red ﬂowers (reddish morph), while northern populations have yellow (yellowish morph) or pink ﬂowers (pinkish morph). I used two noncoding chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) regions to investigate the genetic afﬁnities between S. hookeri and the three morphs of S. grahamii. I also performed intra- and interspeciﬁc crosses to assess whether gene ﬂow between species was possible. Phylogenetic analyses supported the existence of two differentiated clades that did not match currently accepted taxonomic classiﬁcation. Accordingly, genetic distance did not correlate signiﬁcantly with morphological distance. No fruits were produced from interspeciﬁc crosses, and there were no individuals with intermediate morphology that could indicate current and frequent hybridization events between species. I propose that the discordance between cpDNA data and conventional taxonomy could be explained by parallel evolution, or alternatively, by a very sporadic hybridization.},

	abstract = {Delayed selﬁng has been considered the best-of-both-worlds response to pollinator unpredictability because it can provide reproductive assurance without decreasing outcrossing potential. According to this hypothesis, selﬁng rates in delayed selﬁng species should be highly variable in ﬂuctuating pollinator environments. To test this prediction, as well to explore the consequences of delayed selﬁng on genetic patterns, we compared two sister species that grow in the high Andes of Chile: Schizanthus grahamii that exhibits delayed selﬁng and Schizanthus hookeri, which is self-compatible but requires pollinators for seed set. We estimated genetic diversity within and among ﬁve populations of each species using six shared microsatellites. Our results indicated that selﬁng rates in S. grahamii (range 0.07–0.81) were signiﬁcantly more variable than in S. hookeri (range 0–0.26). The highest levels of selﬁng were found in the populations of S. grahamii located at highest altitudes (r = 0.78) and at northern margin range, where pollinators are probably more scarce. These populations also showed the lowest allelic richness and heterozygosity values. Southern populations of S. grahamii had mixed mating, and showed heterozygosity and diversity values close to those detected for S. hookeri along all the sampled range. Selﬁng in this species results from geitonogamy, and did not covary with altitude. Schizanthus grahamii showed greater population differentiation than S. hookeri. Overall, our results indicated that selﬁng rates were widely variable in S. grahamii, with some populations predominantly selﬁng and others showing mixed mating. This pattern may be associated with the strong ﬂuctuations in pollinator service that typically occur in the high Andes of Chile.},

To this end, we examined four plant–pollinator networks from the Chilean Andes at 338S, in range from 1800 to 3600 m elevation. Our results indicate that network topology is strongly and systematically affected by elevation. At increasing altitude, the number of potential visitors per plant decreased, and species’ degree distributions are closer to random expectations. On the other hand, the nested structure of mutualistic interactions systematically decreased with elevation, and network modularity was signiﬁcantly higher than random expectations over the entire altitudinal range. In addition, at increasing elevations the pollination networks were organized in fewer and more strongly connected modules. Our results suggest that the severe abiotic conditions found at increased elevations translate into less organized pollination networks.},

One of the most critical assumptions of network analysis is that the observed interaction patterns constitute an adequate sample of the set of interactions present in plant–animal communities. In spite of its importance, few studies have evaluated this assumption, and in consequence, there is no consensus on the sensitivity of network metrics to sampling methodological shortcomings. In this study we examined how variation in sampling completeness inﬂuences the estimation of six network metrics frequently used in the literature (connectance, nestedness, modularity, robustness to species loss, path length, and centralization). We analyzed data of 186 ﬂowering plants and 336 pollinator species in 10 networks from a forest-fragmented system in central Chile. Using species-based accumulation curves, we estimated the deviation of network metrics in undersampled communities with respect to exhaustively sampled communities and the effect of network size and sampling evenness on network metrics. Our results indicate that: (1) most metrics were affected by sampling completeness but differed in their sensitivity to sampling effort; (2) nestedness, modularity, and robustness to species loss were less inﬂuenced by insufﬁcient sampling than connectance, path length, and centralization; (3) robustness was mildly inﬂuenced by sampling evenness. These results caution studies that summarize information from databases with high, or unknown, heterogeneity in sampling effort per species and should stimulate researchers to report sampling intensity to standardize its effects in the search for broad patterns in plant–pollinator networks.},

	volume = {132},
	abstract = {In the Andes of Central Chile, ﬂowering commences 1–2 months earlier on equatorial-(north-) facing than on polar- (south-) facing slopes, and pollinator assemblages also differ between these habitats. In order to understand the potential inﬂuence of these differences on gene ﬂow, we monitored ﬂowering periods and insect visitation rates to ﬂowers of 60 individuals of Anarthrophyllum cumingii (Papilionaceae) on two equatorial- and two polarfacing slopes in the Andes of central Chile (33 350 S;70 320 W). Flowering began about 30 days earlier on equatorial-facing slopes. Flowering periods of individuals on slopes with the same aspect had a mean overlap of 0.52, while those on opposite slopes had a mean overlap of 0.15. On equatorial-facing slopes Yramea lathionoides (Lepidoptera) accounted for 60\% of the visits to ﬂowers of A. cumingii, while on polar-facing slopes Centris cineraria (Hymenoptera) was responsible for more than 80\% of ﬂower visits. Average similarities of visitor assemblages among individual plants on slopes with the same aspect was 0.83, while the mean similarity between individuals on opposite slopes was only 0.23. Within slopes ﬂuorescent dyes were dispersed up to 40 m from the donor plants, but there was no movements of dyes between individuals growing on opposite slopes, even when they were separated by less than 10 m. Synchronous blooming and a common pollen vector are necessary conditions for pollen exchange between individuals. The overall probability of pollen exchange estimated by multiplying the inter-individual overlap for both factors, was nearly 0.5 for individuals growing on slopes with the same aspect, and less than 0.04 for individuals growing on opposite slopes. Consequently, at equivalent distances, the probability of pollen exchange between individuals growing on slopes of opposite aspect is more than 10-times lower than between those growing on the same slopes. Seed dispersal cannot compensate for restricted gene ﬂow through pollination, because seeds of A. cumingii were dispersed less than 2 m away from a parent plant. Presumably, restricted gene ﬂow could enhance genetic divergence between populations on slopes of contrasting aspects. This factor could be important in contributing to the high diversity and endemism in the Chilean Andes.},

Pollinator preference for some ﬂoral designs or displays that are lacking or poorly developed in focal plants may constrain the pollination process. Foliar herbivory may affect the expression of ﬂoral traits, thus reducing pollinator attraction. Natural populations of the Andean species Alstroemeria exerens (Alstromeriaceae) in central Chile show high levels of foliar herbivory, and ﬂoral traits show phenotypic variation. In the present ﬁeld study, we addressed the attractive role of ﬂoral traits in A. exerens and the effect of foliar damage on them. Particularly, we posed the following questions: (1) Is there an association between ﬂoral display and design traits and the number and duration of pollinator visits? and (2) Does foliar damage affect the ﬂoral traits associated with pollinator visitation? To assess the attractiveness of ﬂoral traits for pollinators, we recorded the number and duration of visits in 101 focal plants. To evaluate the effects of foliar damage on ﬂoral traits, 100 plants of similar size were randomly assigned to control or damage groups during early bud development. Damaged plants were clipped using scissors (50\% of leaf area) and control plants were manually excluded from natural herbivores ({\textbackslash}5\% of leaf area eaten). During the peak of ﬂowering, we recorded the number of open ﬂowers, and estimated corolla and nectar guide areas.},

We measured the variability of ﬂoral phenotypes of three wild populations of Madia chilensis along a gradient constituted by three topographic positions (south-facing slope, north-facing slope, and ravine). Changes in soil moisture, plant density, leaf water content, and internode elongation were measured for one population over two study years. Pollinator visit probabilities were also estimated. Floral phenotypes were strongly segregated among topographic positions but less segregated among populations. Plants with the lowest water contents and the smallest or least-conspicuous ﬂower heads grew in the drier north-facing slope, while plants with the highest water contents and showier ﬂower design and display grew in the wetter ravine. Probabilities of pollinator visits were higher on the north-facing slope. Differences in ﬂoral phenotypes and probabilities of pollinator visits of M. chilensis were strongly connected to topographic variations at small spatial scale. Topographic heterogeneity at small spatial scale could thus have important consequences for ﬂoral trait evolution and pollination ecology.},

	abstract = {High-elevation ecosystems are traditionally viewed as environments in which predominantly autogamous breeding systems should be selected because of the limited pollinator availability. Chaetanthera renifolia (Asteraceae) is an endemic monocarpic triennial herb restricted to a narrow altitudinal range within the high Andes of central Chile (3300–3500 m a.s.l.), just below the vegetation limit. This species displays one of the larger capitulum within the genus. Under the reproductive assurance hypothesis, and considering its short longevity (monocarpic triennial), an autogamous breeding system and low levels of pollen limitation would be predicted for C. renifolia. In contrast, considering its large floral size, a xenogamous breeding system, and significant levels of pollen limitation could be expected. In addition, the increased pollination probability hypothesis predicts prolonged stigma longevity for high alpine plants. We tested these alternative predictions by performing experimental crossings in the field to establish the breeding system and to measure the magnitude of pollen limitation in two populations of C. renifolia. In addition, we measured the stigma longevity in unpollinated and open pollinated capitula, and pollinator visitation rates in the field. We found low levels of self-compatibility and significant levels of pollen limitation in C. renifolia. Pollinator visitation rates were moderate (0.047–0.079 visits per capitulum per 30 min). Although pollinator visitation rate significantly differed between populations, they were not translated into differences in achene output. Finally, C. renifolia stigma longevity of unpollinated plants was extremely long and significantly higher than that of open pollinated plants (26.362.8 days vs. 10.162.2, respectively), which gives support to the increased pollination probability hypothesis for high-elevation flowering plants. Our results add to a growing number of studies that show that xenogamous breeding systems and mechanisms to increase pollination opportunities can be selected in high-elevation ecosystems.},

If pollinatormediated correlational selection occurs, nonadditive effects of both traits are expected, albeit only when the effect of manipulating the state of such traits is disadvantageous with respect to the naturally occurring inﬂorescences, and provided that plants are not limited by pollinators for seed set and pollen export. Escallonia myrtoidea was very strongly pollinator-limited for seed set and pollen export. Pollinator-mediated additive effects were not observed in the frequency of visits by pollinators, pollen export, and seed set of E. myrtoidea after experiencing scent and inﬂorescence size manipulations. Consequently, there was no support for pollinator-mediated correlational selection between those traits, suggesting the prevalence of genetic and/or developmental factors.},

	abstract = {We studied the pollination and reproductive success in continuous and fragmented populations of Lapageria rosea, a self-compatible plant endemic to temperate forests of Chile. Pollinator abundance, visitation rates, ﬂower abundance, nectar volume and concentration, pollen germination and fruit and seed production, were compared between continuous forest of 145 ha and four forest fragments of 6, 3, 3, and 1 ha respectively, surrounded by mature pine plantations of Pinus radiata. Flower abundance was lower in three out of four forest fragments relative to continuous forest. Nectar volume and sugar concentration did not diﬀer between ﬂowers in the two habitats. Pollinators of L. rosea, the hummingbird Sephanoides sephaniodes and bumblebee Bombus dahlbomii were less abundant and visited ﬂowers of L. rosea at lower rates in fragments than in continuous forest. In addition, in vitro rates of pollen germination were lower for ﬂowers in forest fragments. The number of seeds per fruit was also lower in forest fragments. We suggest that fragmentation aﬀects the reproductive success of L. rosea, lowering the total numbers of seeds produced and possibly compromising long term persistence of fragmented populations.},

	abstract = {Background – Habitat fragmentation may have detrimental effects on both plant-mutualistic (i.e. pollination) and plant-antagonistic interactions (i.e. foliar herbivory). Such double negative effects may lead to a change in fitness, because the negative effects of a loss of a mutualism may be counterbalanced by the positive effects of a loss of an antagonism. In spite of being of great importance, however, the assessment of such ecological relationships has traditionally been performed separately. Approach – We evaluated fragmentation and edge effects on floral and foliar display, frequency of pollinator visits, foliar herbivory, and reproductive success, assessed as number of fruits per plant, number of seeds per fruit, and number of seeds per plant, on Bomarea salsilla, a xenogamous vine from southern Chile.
Results – Plants occurring at fragments and edges exhibited a smaller floral display and a larger foliar display, and were rarely visited and preyed upon by pollinators and herbivores, respectively. The number of fruits per plant, the number of seeds per fruit, and number of seeds per plant were lower in fragments and at edges than at the core of continuous forest. Although forest fragmentation had a detrimental effect on herbivory, herbivores did not play a modulating role on the lowered pollinator-mediated reproductive success of B. salsilla probably due to the scarcity of foliar attack.
Conclusion – Decreased reproductive success of Bomarea salsilla plants due to forest fragmentation and the creation of edge habitats was not counterbalanced by foliar herbivory as expected. The ecological scenario faced by B. salsilla may be a representative phenomenon of numerous other species of the fragmented forests of South America.},

This review is only limited to these years because articles on plant-lizard interactions during this period have used more rigorous experimental approaches than those made previously. All compiled data were analyzed considering the conceptual framework provided by the quantity and quality components of pollination and seed dispersal (i.e., effectiveness), since this information is essential to have an idea of the relative contribution of animals to plant fitness. Results showed that 34 species of lizards feed on nectar and fruits of plants. While lizards consume these plant materials, they could effectively pollinate flowers or disperse seeds to sites away from parent plants. However, more studies on particular aspects of these interactions should be conducted in order to completely understand the ecological and evolutionary effects of lizards on plants.},
